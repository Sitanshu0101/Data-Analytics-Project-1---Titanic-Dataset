"🚢 Exploring Titanic Dataset with Python: Data Analytics Unleashed 📊

Step into the world of data analytics as we dissect the Titanic Dataset using the power of Python programming! 🌟 In this project, I've meticulously executed a series of operations to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

📥 Data Import and Cleaning:
Using the Pandas library, I've seamlessly imported the dataset and embarked on a journey of data cleaning. Leveraging is-null metrics, I've identified and addressed missing values. Unwanted columns have been dropped to streamline the analysis.

🔍 Unveiling the IQR Technique:
My analysis doesn't stop at the surface level. I've employed the Interquartile Range (IQR) statistical technique to identify and remove outliers, ensuring the integrity of the data and the accuracy of insights derived.

📊 Visualizing Insights with Seaborn:
Seaborn, a powerful data visualization tool, comes to the forefront as I've crafted a visual narrative. Heatmaps, distplots, jointplots, and pairplots are among the techniques employed to unravel correlations, distributions, and underlying trends.

🎯 Key Objectives Achieved:
My analysis revolves around showcasing the journey from data import to visualization, emphasizing data cleanliness, outlier treatment, and the story brought to life through visuals.
