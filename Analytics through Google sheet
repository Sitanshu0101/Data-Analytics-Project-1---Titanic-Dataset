"🚢 Titanic Dataset Data Analytics: Unveiling Insights with Google Sheets 📊

Welcome to my Titanic Dataset data analytics project, powered by Google Sheets! 🌟 In this endeavor, I've harnessed the potential of data processing, aggregation metrics, pivot tables, and data visualization to decode the story behind the Titanic dataset.

🔍 Exploring the Data:
I've meticulously processed the dataset, extracting invaluable information about passengers, their demographics, and survival statuses. Through data aggregation metrics, I've distilled complex data into meaningful patterns.

📊 Pivot Tables in Action:
With carefully designed pivot tables, I've dissected the dataset based on marked objectives. These tables serve as dynamic tools to unravel insights, providing a clearer perspective on passenger attributes and survival outcomes.

📈 Visualizing Insights:
Data visualization takes center stage, translating data-driven revelations into visual narratives. I've transformed numbers into compelling charts and graphs, making it easier to grasp trends, correlations, and underlying stories.

🎯 Marked Objectives:
The objectives guiding this analysis range from uncovering survival rates based on gender and age groups to exploring patterns among passengers' attributes.
